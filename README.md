Simple ClojureScript Examples
=============================

Curated list of ClojureScript sample applications suited for those starting with ClojureScript


For newcomers to ClojureScript I think it is important to have working examples that are insightful and educating.

Preferably the examples meet the following requirements:

* short and simple (not thousands of lines of code)
* easy to understand for total beginners with ClojureScript
* easy to run when following steps documented in README 

  For example: 
  * `lein cljsbuild once`
  * `open index.html`
  
* not dependent on too many third party libraries
* well maintained 

  Examples that don't work with a recent version of `lein cljsbuild` and ClojureScript will be notified or removed.

The examples I collected so far (with the help of the people on the [ClojureScript](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojurescript/84nnVJ2OLvU) mailing list):
